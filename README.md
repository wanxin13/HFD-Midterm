The Midterm is due on October 4th by 11:59 pm.

Exam questions are in the `Midterm.pdf` file.

You must push your local repository back to GitHub before the deadline.
Your repository must contain:

-   The Matlab code you used to complete the exam in its entirety (including auxiliary functions and scripts);
-   A `main.m` file that should generate all plots for all exam exercises when run;
-   A `report.pdf` file with your answers to the exam questions.

The exam uses stock data.
This data should not be pushed to the repository.
Instead, keep it in a `Data` folder outside your project folder.
